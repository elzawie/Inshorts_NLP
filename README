In this Jupyter Notebook we will be working with news articles retrieved from https://inshorts.com - website that gives us short, 60-word news articles on a wide variety of topics. Inshorts provides news for 12 thematically different sets of content like: Sports, Politics, Business and Technology.

The main focus is to cover some aspects of NLP like:
- Data retrieval with web scraping
- Text wrangling and pre-processing
- Parts of Speech tagging + visualizing dependencies
- Named Entity Recognition
- Feature Engineering
- Building classifiers able to recognize type of content based on words used in the article
